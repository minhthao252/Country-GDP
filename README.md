# Global GDP Visualization with Power BI
This repository showcases a Power BI project focused on visualizing global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population data. The project explores economic trends and demographic distributions across different regions, countries, and income groups over time.

## Data
The visualization uses global economic and population data. While the specific source isn't detailed in the provided visuals, such data is commonly sourced from international organizations like the World Bank, which provides comprehensive datasets on GDP, population, and various development indicators. The data includes time-series information allowing for the analysis of trends over several decades.

## Tool
This project was developed using Microsoft Power BI. Power BI is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

## Visualizations
The Power BI report includes several key visualizations to provide insights into global GDP and population:

+ GDP by Income Group: A visualization showing the total GDP contribution from different income classifications (High income, Upper middle income, Lower middle income, Low income).

+ Population by Region and Country: A map or treemap-like visualization illustrating population distribution across different global regions and specific countries, often showing the percentage contribution of each country.

+ GDP by Year and Country: A line chart displaying the trend of GDP over time for selected countries, allowing for comparison of economic growth trajectories.

+ Population by Year and Country: Similar to the GDP chart, this visualization shows population trends over time for selected countries.

+ Average of GDP by Income Group: A bar chart comparing the average GDP across different income groups.

These visualizations collectively offer a dynamic view of global economic landscapes and demographic shifts.
